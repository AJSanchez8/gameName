  - *There might be an API that can be used to complement it with data from a popular gaming website.

- Fix the theme switch button; it's not changing the theme properly; it only changes the footer.
- Fine-tune both light and dark themes since I haven't changed them yet because the button is not working.
- Fix the button that calculates the price per hour; I'd like it to update in real-time as you type.
- In the future, purchase the domain.
- Add English language support.
